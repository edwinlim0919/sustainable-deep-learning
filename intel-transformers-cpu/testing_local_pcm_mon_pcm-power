Core Power License 0: Core cycles where the core was running with power-delivery for baseline license level 0.  This includes non-AVX codes, SSE, AVX 128-bit, and low-current AVX 256-bit codes.
Core Power License 1: Core cycles where the core was running with power-delivery for license level 1.  This includes high current AVX 256-bit instructions as well as low current AVX 512-bit instructions.
Core Power License 2: Core cycles where the core was running with power-delivery for license level 2 (introduced in Skylake Server michroarchtecture). This includes high current AVX 512-bit instructions.
